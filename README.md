# DataStructuresQuiz
Quiz on the applications of Data Structures (console application in C++)

This application was created as an assignment for my Data Structures course at Westwood College. 
Its purpose is to quiz programming students on the applications of various data structures. It is not
a fully fledged "game" and runs the same questions every time, but functions as it was intended.
